# Arduino

This Repository contains code for a self driving buggy using arduino.  This was completed as part of a team in the 2E10 design module in tcd.  Three different challenges were completed.

Bronze Challenge:
The aim for the buggy in this challenge is to traverse the circuit track without derailing, stopping at detected objects and listening to "Stop" and "Go" commands from 
the processing IDE

Silver Challenge:
In this challenge the buggy must traverse a circuit track without derailing while detecting objects and following them at a safe distance using proportional integral derivative (PID) control, and listening to "Stop" and "Go" commands.

Gold Challenge:
For this challenge a self balancing buggy was created similar to a segway.  This was achieved using the buggy's inertial measurement units (IMU) and the PID control.
